# PlinkerRPC - Base91

Base91 is an advanced method for encoding binary data as ASCII characters. 
It is similar to base64, but is more efficient and compact. 
The overhead produced by base91 depends on the input data. It amounts at 
most to 23% (versus 33% for base64) and can range down to 14%, which typically 
occurs on 0-byte blocks. This makes base91 very useful for transferring larger 
files over binary unsafe connections like e-mail or terminal lines.

This component was originally used as part of the core for encoding the encrypted payload, but is no longer used as to support the PHP extention version of the client.

## Install

Require this package with composer using the following command:

``` bash
$ composer require plinker/base91
```

## Client

Creating a client instance is done as follows:


    <?php
    require 'vendor/autoload.php';

    /**
     * Initialize plinker client.
     *
     * @param string $server - URL to server listener.
     * @param string $config - server secret, and/or a additional component data
     */
    $client = new \Plinker\Core\Client(
        'http://example.com/server.php',
        [
            'secret' => 'a secret password'
        ]
    );
    
    // or using global function
    $client = plinker_client('http://example.com/server.php', 'a secret password');
